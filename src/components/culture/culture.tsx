        Our wedding is more than a celebration of our love—it’s a vibrant fusion
        of the cultures that have shaped us. With roots in Malaysia and Greece,
        we are thrilled to share the beauty of our traditions, blending Greek
        Orthodox customs with Malaysian-Chinese heritage. Here’s what makes our
        wedding truly unique:

        Whether you’re learning a new dance step, savoring a traditional dish,
        or witnessing a unique custom for the first time, we hope this day will
        be as enriching and unforgettable for you as it is for us. Thank you for
        being part of our beautiful celebration!
