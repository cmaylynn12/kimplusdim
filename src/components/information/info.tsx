              international cities. The main airport that you would be flying
              into is Athens Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport.

              It is located approximately 33 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
              downtown Athens and is easily accessible by various transportation
              options. If youâ€™re traveling to the city center, you can take the
              Metro Line 3 (Blue Line) directly to the airport, with a journey
              time of about 40 minutes.

              For those arriving by car, the airport is well-connected via the
              Attiki Odos toll road. Whether youâ€™re flying in or out, the
              airport is modern, efficient, and equipped with excellent
              facilities to ensure a smooth travel experience.
